# CRUD_DEMO
This is a simple crud web application to keep it simple I used flask as web server and mongodb as database engine, merging everything with python	

we need to install required libraries other than python 2.7

>apt-get install python2.7

>apt-get install mongodb

>apt-get install pymongo

>pip install Flask

to launch

>FLASK_APP=CRUD_DEMO.py flask run

open a broswer and go to localhost:5000/viewlist for a minimal web interface
or
you can make remote calls to
localhost:5000/list

localhost:5000/create

localhost:5000/update

localhost:5000/delete

localhost:5000/find

as listed in the CRUD_DEMO_API.json file

enjoy :)
